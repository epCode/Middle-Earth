# Middle Earth

Middle Earth is a rouge-like sub game of Luanti based on the literary works of Tolkien that focuses on player survival.
There is an "Ultimate Goal" which is to defeat Morgoth Lord of Darkness in his fortress, Angband.


(Much inspiration for this game was taken from Tomenet, formerly Mangband)
